_Disclaimer: This is going to sound extremely petty. Poor baby is frustrated because he logistically can't spend â‚¬4000, oh no!_

Attentive readers know that I've been talking about how VR and AR are going to be the future of interfaces for years. One of the main reasons for me finally getting into coding was [knowing that I had to be able to manipulate real interfaces directly](designers-that-dont-code), especially when interface design is entering the third dimension.

Apple's Vision Pro announcement came quite a few years after I first pronounced XR to be the future of computing. I immediately put the required money into a budget meant for Vision Pro as soon as it would become available. It was my goal to be there, on day one, playing around with the hardware, writing software, and experiencing the new frontier of interface design firsthand.

Well, that didn't quite work out. I somehow didn't expect Apple to only sell it in the US at first. That, combined with the fact that you need to go to an Apple Store to have your face and eyes measured for the device to be properly set up, creates a logistical hurdle that I'm not willing to jump over. I won't fly to the US just to buy a device.

So, this is me, frustrated that I have to sit on the sidelines, watching other people discover a device I've been waiting for for years. This is obviously irrational because I'm not actually losing anything, except perhaps for a head start in spatial computing experience but still... it hurts a little.

At least it's a good exercise in patience.
