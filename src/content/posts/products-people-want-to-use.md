The other day, I realized why I'm not motivated to finish my current app project. It's a gratitude journal that isn't crammed full of esoteric features and inspirational mantras. It would fit perfectly into my existing product portfolio and is genuinely fun to use.

After forcing myself to work on it for a couple more weeks, while only making incremental improvements, I couldn't pretend anymore and took a few days off. Then it finally hit me:

It's yet another app people don't want to use.

They think they want to use it. They know they should use it. But in the end, it's one of those "I guess I should try to incorporate this habit into my life" apps. Just like my others:

- [Henlo](https://tiptop.software/henlo): "I guess I should start reaching out to friends more."
- [Stoins](https://tiptop.software/stoins): "I guess I should walk more."
- [Peat](https://tiptop.software/peat): "I guess I should work on my habits more."

I might be a bit biased, but all of those are great apps. They actually help people achieve their goals.

It's just that I don't have it in me to create another app like that right now.

Improving your social life, health, and habits takes weeks of work before you notice a difference. I'd like to work on something that provides value as soon as you download the app.

I decided that my next app will provide value in seconds. I put the gratitude journal app on ice and started working on a little app that solves one of the annoyances in my life.

Yay for not succumbing to the sunk cost fallacy.
